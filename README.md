# Welcome
The purpose of the QBRC Github page is to:

1. Publicize the QRBC group as a team.
2. Provide a central place for new and old team members to browse through all our tools, and promote internal collaborations.
3. Record keeping for all in-house algorithms and tools.
# Repo forking steps
You are invited to fork your finished or WIP (working-in-progress) repo here in the QBRC page. To do this, you will need to follow a few steps.

A bot is already set up to automatically keep your forked repo in QBRC up-to-date with your personal copy.

## Walkthrough
1. Get in contact with admins(Yunguan, Mo, Bo or Jiwoong) to be added as a member of QBRC Github organization. You need to be added as a member before you can fork a repo to QBRC.

2. Go to the desired repo and fork it to QBRC.

3. Next, please work with admin to decide the team and people who should have access to your repo. This can be set in the repo settings of the repo you just forked.

You can assign admin, read-only, and read-and-write access to members. Please note that the group member that you do not add will **NOT** see your forked repo if it is set to private.

The following steps are optional and will only work if the repo you forked from is public. 

4. [Optional] Go to the repo settings, scroll all the way down, and transfer the repo to QBRC.
